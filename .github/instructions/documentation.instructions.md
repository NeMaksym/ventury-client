# Documentation Guidelines

## Code Comments

-   Generate JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public functions, components, props, and types.
-   Ensure comments are clear, concise, and accurately describe the purpose, parameters, and return values (where applicable).

## Markdown Documentation

-   Assist with creating or updating Markdown documentation for components, features, or architectural decisions.
-   Ensure Markdown is well-formatted and easy to read.
