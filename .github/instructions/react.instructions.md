# React Development Guidelines

## Component Development

-   Always use named exports for React components.
-   Always name React component files (`.tsx`) using `PascalCase`.
-   Ensure components are modular and follow the single-responsibility principle.
-   Never write overly complex components; break them down into smaller, manageable pieces.
-   Generate React functional components and hooks adhering to project conventions.
